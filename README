=head1 NAME

Parrot Smoke Test Suite

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  sh smoke.sh [/usr/CPAN/perl-current [smoke.cfg]]

  or

  perl smoke.pl [/usr/CPAN/parrot-current [smoke.cfg]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The parrot smoke test suite is a set of simple scripts that try to
run the parrot tests on as many configurations as possible and combine
that into a easy to parse report.

The parrot source tree is refreshed using rsync to the latest level of the
parrot development branche before the smoke tests start. Note that rsync in
the smoke uses --delete, which <b>removes</b> any existing files on that
directory that are not part of the perl source tree.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Create an empty directory where the perl source tree is to be placed when
smoking (e.g. /usr/3gl/CPAN/parrot-current or C:\parrot-current).

Create or use a location to put the three scripts needed for the smoke
(e.g. /usr/3gl/CPAN/smoke or C:\smoke), and put the files from the
distribution there. Probably you already did so, because you are
reading this file.

Edit smoke.sh ( for UNIX-like systems ) or smoke.pl ( for Win32 )
and change the PC= definition to reflect the location you
just chose in the first step of the initialisation.
For Win32 systems you might want to change the 'make' program used
Either of nmake and GNU make are available.
Theoretically you are now ready to go, just follow the SYNOPSIS
to give it a first shot for tonight.

Optionally delete lines from smoke.cfg (or a local copy with a different
name) for which you are certail your system doesn't support it.

If something useful happens, do it every night using cron instead of at.
